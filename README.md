# PES6-EXE-modifier
###### Tool that allows changing of various constants inside of pes6.exe (including changing online servers without modifying etc\hosts file)
\
Simple, open source, java AWR/Swing tool which is able to modify following pes6.exe values:

* Online server addresses (NEW! - as far as I saw none of the previous tools did that)
* ML Start Year (tnx to MxSonic for offsets)
* OPT file location (you can change name of the folder in which OF is stored (so you can have multiple patches installed)
* (broken, source code only) Camera Zoom settings
